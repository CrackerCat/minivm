# MiniVM
A Small VM.

MiniVM is a virtual machine implemented in c. This project was originally an exploration into fast interpreters.

Originally a stack machine, MiniVM was created to run a small lisp-like language, but now runs a language close to ASM.

MiniVM allows for aribtrary recursion, as well as tail calls. It is a register + stack machine with shorthand opcocdes.
